	<p> Hi, this is Mike Chen. Just to give a quick background introduction to myself: I am currently a freshman in Thurgood Marshall College at UCSD. Though I initially entered as a chemistry major, soon I decided chemical engineering, research on petroleum refinery, inspection on structure of molecules are definitely not what I would like to do lifelong for my heart, so I switched to cognitive science HCI specialization, now I am considering a double major in cognitive science and computer engineering or computer science joint with math program.
